## üìÖ Day 2 ‚Äì 19 June 2025

**Environment Used:**  
Google Colab (also tested in VS Code Jupyter extension)

**Topics Practiced:**
- Core data structures: list, tuple, set, dictionary
- List comprehension & nested dictionary access
- Writing functions: factorial, prime check
- Using built-in modules: `math`, `random`, `datetime`
- Exception handling: try, except, finally
- Mini logic problems: FizzBuzz, max in list, string reversal

**Tasks Completed:**
- Created and pushed `day2_python_fundamentals.ipynb` inside `training/`
- Implemented multiple practical examples and exercises
- Logged work in this `progress.md` file

**Learnings:**
- Improved confidence with data structures
- Gained better clarity on writing reusable functions
- Learned how to handle runtime errors gracefully
- Strengthened logic through small coding challenges

**Challenges:**
- Slight confusion in exception handling syntax, resolved with testing and debug

## üìÖ Day 3 ‚Äì 20 June 2025

**Environment Used:**  
Google Colab (verified in VS Code Jupyter extension)

**Dataset Used:**  
- Seaborn's built-in **Iris** dataset  
- Also created dummy DataFrame and Series using dictionaries and lists

**Topics Practiced:**
- Pandas Series & DataFrame creation
- Dataset exploration using `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.isnull().sum()`
- Accessing and filtering data with `df['col']`, `.loc[]`, `.iloc[]`
- Modifying data (adding, dropping columns)
- Aggregation methods: `.sort_values()`, `.value_counts()`, `.mean()`, `.sum()`, `.max()`, etc.

**Tasks Completed:**
- Created and pushed `day3_pandas_intro.ipynb` inside `training/`
- Practiced Pandas with both dummy and real datasets
- Logged progress with key syntax and learning in this `progress.md`

**Learnings:**
- Understood the difference between Pandas Series and DataFrame
- Learned how to inspect, clean, and manipulate tabular data
- Explored aggregation and statistical summaries for EDA
- Practiced building clean and well-structured Pandas code

**Challenges:**
- Minor confusion with `.iloc[]` slicing and column selection syntax ‚Äî resolved by experimenting with samples
